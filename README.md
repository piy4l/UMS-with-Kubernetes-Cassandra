# UMS-with-Kubernetes-Cassandra
This is a responsive web application based on CSE 408 Software Development course. The modules are divided into microservices in order to work efficiently with the modules and to work with Kubernetes and Cassandra.
Express.js is used as backend and React is used as frontend. Cassandra is used as distributed database. 
Finally minikube is used as partial implementation of Kubernetes.
